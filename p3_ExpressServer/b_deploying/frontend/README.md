# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

run with firstly `npm install`, open 2 terminal, one input with `npm run server`, and another with `npm run dev` or `npx vite --port=4000`

seems something wrong with the mark important label, but this is the same as the official github repo [here](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/part2-notes-frontend/tree/part2-6 ), no idea what happened.
